# Grafana dashboards

This is a sample of a dashboard developed at my work at Solarity.cl

Grafana is a very good open source project for generating KPI and reports with live data from multiple data sources.

At Solarity we used this tool for visualizing all the photovoltaic generation plants installed at out customers facilities.

This allowed us to avoid having to hop through multiple vendors platforms in order to get a general overview of our operation.

Aditionally with Grafana we automated some unusual behaviour of our plants like generation outage, power loss and communication failure.
